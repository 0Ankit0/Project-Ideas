# Requirements Document - Backend as a Service Platform

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
Build a production-ready backend-as-a-service platform that provides Appwrite/Supabase-like developer capabilities through a stable facade over pluggable packages and providers, while using PostgreSQL as the mandatory relational, metadata, and policy backbone.

### 1.2 Scope

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|--------------|
| Multi-tenant projects, environments, and control-plane management | Full custom implementation of every backend primitive from scratch |
| Unified auth, data API, storage, functions/jobs, and realtime/event abstractions | Build-your-own cloud provider |
| Provider adapters and capability bindings | Arbitrary unsupported package execution without certification |
| PostgreSQL-backed metadata and data API control | Non-Postgres primary database engines in v1 |
| Secrets, auditing, usage visibility, and switchover workflows | Full billing engine or marketplace |
| SDK/API contracts independent of provider choice | Unlimited one-off provider-specific customizations that break facade semantics |

### 1.3 Operating Model
- The platform is multi-tenant and organizes work into tenants, projects, environments, and capability bindings.
- PostgreSQL is mandatory for shared platform metadata and for the platform's core data API model.
- Capability providers are pluggable, but only through certified adapters that implement stable internal contracts.
- Provider choices may be changed later through documented migration and switchover flows.
- The platform is API-first and should expose stable SDK-facing semantics even when underlying providers differ.

### 1.4 Primary Actors

| Actor | Goals |
|-------|-------|
| Project Owner / Tenant Admin | Provision projects, choose providers, manage secrets and policies |
| App Developer | Integrate auth, data, storage, functions, and realtime through one surface |
| Platform Operator | Keep the platform healthy, scalable, and observable |
| Security / Compliance Admin | Protect secrets, enforce auditability, and reduce provider-risk exposure |
| Adapter Maintainer | Add or evolve provider integrations without breaking facade contracts |
| Application End User | Use applications built on the BaaS without knowing provider specifics |

## 4. Constraints and Assumptions

- PostgreSQL is the required core platform dependency and is not optional in v1.
- Adapters may wrap existing packages or cloud-provider SDKs rather than reimplementing capability internals.
- Only certified adapters are allowed to participate in project capability bindings.
- Provider switching may require explicit migration steps, double-write periods, or temporary degraded mode depending on capability.
- The platform must preserve facade stability even when underlying providers differ in optional features.

## 5. Success Metrics

- 100% of provider-binding changes are auditable and reversible where supported.
- 95% of app-developer workflows do not require provider-specific code changes after capability selection.
- 100% of supported adapters pass contract conformance tests before activation.
- Platform operators can identify adapter failures, migration state, and project capability health from one control plane.

## 6. Contract and Isolation Requirements (Normative)

### 6.1 Canonical API Contract
| Contract ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| API-CON-001 | All control-plane APIs SHALL be exposed under `/api/v1/control/*` and data-plane APIs under `/api/v1/runtime/*`. |
| API-CON-002 | Mutations SHALL require `Idempotency-Key` and return identical response bodies for equivalent replays within 24 hours. |
| API-CON-003 | Errors SHALL follow `{error:{code,category,message,retryable,correlationId,details}}`. |
| API-CON-004 | Async operations SHALL return `202` + `operationId` and support `GET /api/v1/control/operations/{operationId}`. |

### 6.2 Tenancy and Isolation Requirements
| Model Area | MUST requirement |
|---|---|
| Identity boundary | Tenant, project, environment identifiers are mandatory on every mutable command. |
| Data isolation | PostgreSQL row-level policies enforce `(tenant_id, project_id, env_id)` predicates for all runtime data tables. |
| Compute isolation | Function workers execute with environment-scoped service accounts and secret scopes. |
| Network isolation | Per-environment egress policy objects block cross-tenant private endpoint access. |

### 6.3 Lifecycle States (Required)

    provisioning --> ready
    ready --> degraded
    degraded --> ready
    ready --> maintenance
    maintenance --> ready
    maintenance --> retired
    retired --> [*]
```

### 6.4 Error Taxonomy (Required)
- `VAL_*` validation/schema violations (HTTP 400/422).
- `AUTHN_*` authentication/session failures (HTTP 401).
- `AUTHZ_*` authorization/policy failures (HTTP 403).
- `STATE_*` invalid transitions or optimistic lock conflicts (HTTP 409).
- `DEP_*` provider or network dependency failures (HTTP 502/503/504).
- `INT_*` internal platform failures (HTTP 500).

### 6.5 SLI/SLO Mapping
| Journey | SLI | SLO |
|---|---|---|
| Provision environment | Success ratio of `POST /control/environments` | >= 99.9% monthly |
| Facade CRUD request | p95 latency + non-2xx rate | p95 < 250 ms, errors < 0.5% |
| Function invoke | Queue delay + completion ratio | p95 delay < 2s, completion >= 99.5% |
| Realtime delivery | publish->deliver latency | p95 < 5s |

### 6.6 Migration and Versioning Guidance
1. Use expand/contract schema migrations with dual-write only during migration windows.
2. Switchover providers per capability using ring rollout: dev -> staging -> prod-canary -> prod.
3. Maintain compatibility matrix for SDK version to API major/minor support.
4. Deprecations require published sunset date and one full minor cycle warning.
