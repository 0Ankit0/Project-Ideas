# onboarding-and-offboarding

## Typical Failure Modes
- Invalid or stale upstream state transitions
- Concurrency collisions and duplicate processing
- Missing enrichment data at decision points
- User-initiated cancellation during in-flight operations

## Detection
- Domain validation errors with structured reason codes
- Latency/error-rate anomalies on critical endpoints
- Data consistency checks and reconciliation deltas

## Recovery
- Idempotent retries with bounded backoff
- Compensation workflows for partial completion
- Operator runbook with manual override controls

## Process Narrative (Onboarding/offboarding exception playbook)
1. **Initiate**: Hr Operations Lead captures the primary change request for **Onboarding And Offboarding** and links it to business objectives, impacted modules, and target release windows.
2. **Design/Refine**: The team elaborates flows, assumptions, acceptance criteria, and exception paths specific to onboarding/offboarding exception playbook.
3. **Authorize**: Approval checks confirm that changes satisfy policy, architecture, and compliance constraints before promotion.
4. **Execute**: Lifecycle Engine executes the approved path and enforces lifecycle gate checks at run-time or publication-time.
5. **Integrate**: Outputs are synchronized to dependent services (IAM, payroll, reporting, notifications, and audit store) with idempotent correlation IDs.
6. **Verify & Close**: Stakeholders reconcile expected outcomes against actual telemetry to confirm joiner-leaver control.

## Role/Permission Matrix (Onboarding And Offboarding)
| Capability | Employee | Manager | HR/People Ops | Engineering/IT | Compliance/Audit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| View onboarding and offboarding artifacts | Scoped self | Team scoped | Full | Full | Read-only full |
| Propose change | Request only | Draft + justify | Draft + justify | Draft + justify | No |
| Approve publication/use | No | Conditional | Primary approver | Technical approver | Control sign-off |
| Execute override | No | Limited with reason | Limited with reason | Break-glass with ticket | No |
| Access evidence trail | No | Limited | Full | Full | Full |

## Integration Behavior (Onboarding And Offboarding)
| Integration | Trigger | Expected Behavior | Failure Handling |
|---|---|---|---|
| IAM / RBAC | Approval or assignment change | Sync permission scopes for affected actors | Retry + alert on drift |
| Workflow/Event Bus | State transition | Publish canonical event with correlation ID | Dead-letter + replay tooling |
| Payroll/Benefits (where applicable) | Compensation/lifecycle change | Apply financial side-effects only after approved state | Hold payout + reconcile |
| Notification Channels | Review decision, exception, due date | Deliver actionable notice to owners and requestors | Escalation after SLA breach |
| Audit/GRC Archive | Any controlled transition | Store immutable evidence bundle | Block progression if evidence missing |

## Onboarding/Offboarding Edge Cases (Concrete)
- **Rehire with residual access**: If a rehire request reuses a prior identity, retain historical employee ID linkage but force fresh role entitlement approval before day-1 access.
- **Early start-date acceleration**: When onboarding date is moved earlier than background-check SLA, block activation and auto-create an exception approval task.
- **Same-day termination**: For involuntary offboarding, revoke privileged access immediately while preserving records under legal hold classification.
- **Rescinded resignation after downstream sync**: If offboarding is canceled after payroll/IAM notifications, execute compensating events and log full reversal trail.

## Compliance/Audit Controls
| Control | Description | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Segregation of duties | Requestor and approver cannot be the same identity for controlled actions | Approval chain + user IDs |
| Transition integrity | Only allowed state transitions can be persisted | Transition log + rejection reasons |
| Timely deprovisioning | Offboarding access revocation meets SLA targets | IAM revocation timestamp report |
| Financial reconciliation | Payroll-impacting changes reconcile before close | Payroll batch diff + sign-off |
| Immutable auditability | Controlled actions are archived in WORM/append-only storage | Hash, retention tag, archive pointer |
