# Business Rules

This document defines enforceable policy rules for **Messaging and Notification Platform** so command processing, asynchronous jobs, and operational actions behave consistently under normal and exceptional conditions.

## Context
- Domain focus: messaging and notification workflows.
- Rule categories: lifecycle transitions, authorization, compliance, and resilience.
- Enforcement points: APIs, workflow/state engines, background processors, and administrative consoles.

## Enforceable Rules
1. Every state-changing command must pass authentication, authorization, and schema validation before processing.
2. Lifecycle transitions must follow the configured state graph; invalid transitions are rejected with explicit reason codes.
3. High-impact operations (financial, security, or regulated data actions) require additional approval evidence.
4. Manual overrides must include approver identity, rationale, and expiration timestamp.
5. Retries and compensations must be idempotent and must not create duplicate business effects.

## Rule Evaluation Pipeline

    A[Incoming Command] --> B[Validate Payload]
    B --> C{Authorized Actor?}
    C -- No --> C1[Reject + Security Audit]
    C -- Yes --> D{Business Rules Pass?}
    D -- No --> D1[Reject + Rule Violation Event]
    D -- Yes --> E{State Transition Allowed?}
    E -- No --> E1[Return Conflict]
    E -- Yes --> F[Commit Transaction]
    F --> G[Publish Domain Event]
    G --> H[Update Read Models and Alerts]
```

## Exception and Override Handling
- Overrides are restricted to approved exception classes and require dual logging (business + security audit).
- Override windows automatically expire and trigger follow-up verification tasks.
- Repeated override patterns are reviewed for policy redesign and automation improvements.
