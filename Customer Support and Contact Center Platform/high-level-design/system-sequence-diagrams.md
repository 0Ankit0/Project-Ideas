# System Sequence Diagrams

## Purpose
Define the system sequence diagrams artifacts for the **Customer Support and Contact Center Platform** with implementation-ready detail.

## Domain Context
- Domain: Support Center
- Core entities: Conversation, Ticket, Queue, SLA Policy, Agent Skill, Bot Session, Escalation
- Primary workflows: intake across channels, skill-based routing and assignment, SLA monitoring and escalation, bot-to-human transfer, QA and workforce planning

## Key Design Decisions
- Enforce idempotency and correlation IDs for all mutating operations.
- Persist immutable audit events for critical lifecycle transitions.
- Separate online transaction paths from async reconciliation/repair paths.

## Reliability and Compliance
- Define SLOs and error budgets for user-facing operations.
- Include RBAC, least-privilege service identities, and full audit trails.
- Provide runbooks for degraded mode, replay, and backfill operations.


## Architecture Emphasis
- Bounded contexts with explicit API and event contracts.
- Read/write model separation where throughput and consistency needs diverge.
- Cross-cutting layers for authn/authz, observability, and policy enforcement.
